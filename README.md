# Vehicle Plate Scanner Extractor

This was my first project, built during the early days of my first year in college.  
A simple real-time vehicle license plate detection and extraction tool using Python, OpenCV, and Tesseract OCR.

## What it does

- Detects license plates from a live camera feed using Haar cascades  
- Crops the detected plates from the frame  
- Extracts the text on the plates using OCR  
- Saves cropped plate images locally  
- Recognizes Indian state codes from the plates  

## How to use

1. Install required Python packages:
2. Make sure Tesseract OCR is installed on your system and set the correct path in the script.  
3. Run the Python script.  
4. Use your webcam to scan vehicle plates in real time.

## Notes

- This project was made to learn and experiment with computer vision and OCR.  
- The detection and OCR may not be perfect and can be improved with further training and tuning.

## Future ideas

- Better OCR accuracy  
- Support for more regions and plate types  
- User interface improvements  
- Additional vehicle-related features

Thank you for checking out my first project.  
This was a learning experience and the foundation for many projects to come.
